     * How the page hears that the Workspace changed under it (docs/design.md, "Storage").

     * last one it saw and reloads what it is showing when this one differs. A count, not a
     * version: it restarts at 0 with the server, and nothing may compare a file against it.
     *
     * **Why a number a page asks for, rather than the server pushing one.** `web` reaches
     * the domain only through this API and the typed client (CLAUDE.md, ADR-0002), and it
     * must gain no second source of truth — so whatever carries the notification has to be
     * a route on this contract. Of the three ways to do that:
     *
     *   polling  one `GET` on the same typed client, the same launch token in the same
     *            `Authorization` header, the same guard, and nothing held open. Costs one
     *            request every couple of seconds on loopback, which reads an integer that
     *            is already in memory and touches no disk: the watcher, not the poll, is
     *            what looks at the folder.
     *   SSE      `EventSource` cannot send an `Authorization` header, so the launch token
     *            would have to move into the query string — logged, and in the Referer —
     *            which is the arrangement ADR-0004 turned down. Reading a stream through
     *            `fetch` instead keeps the header but holds a response open for the life of
     *            the page, which is a connection the server has to be able to drop before
     *            Ctrl-C can end it.
     *   websocket an upgrade needs a per-runtime adapter (`@hono/node-ws` and the `ws`
     *            dependency on Node, Bun's and Deno's own elsewhere). That is a Node-only
     *            API in the one place the design says to avoid one and a runtime dependency
     *            in a server that is meant to bundle with none (docs/design.md, "CLI and
     *            distribution", "Supply chain"), and a browser `WebSocket` cannot send the
     *            header either.
     *
     * A localhost app that reloads a hand-dropped Catalog does not need sub-second news, so
     * the cheapest mechanism that keeps the one edge and the one token wins. Pushing can be
     * added behind this same counter later without `web` learning anything new.
